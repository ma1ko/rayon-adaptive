- how to avoid the name collision on reduce ? just have an hidden name ?
- try zip again
- do we actually need borrowingpariter's len anywhere ?
- do we need to have a method to bound iterations number ? we could just bound directly
in the par_borrow no ? already seen this debate
- successors require sync on dislocated : why ???
